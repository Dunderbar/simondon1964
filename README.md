Author's Intorudction
----------------------------------------

This project is a republishing of Taylor Adkins' 2007 translation of the first chapter of French philosopher Gilbert Simondon's original 1964 text 'L'individu et sa Gen√©se Physico-Biologique' (The Physcio-Biological Genesis of the individual), published by Presses Universitaires de France in 1964.

The original translation can be found in two parts on the website Fractal Ontology (Perma.cc links are provided at the bottom of this document), which Adkins runs alongside Joseph Weissman.

This project was motivated by the relative dearth of English translations of Simondon's work, even so long after the original publications of is writings. This lack of translations is made all the more surprising when one considers the profound influence Simondon's work had on some of the most significant French thinkers of the last half-century, most notably Gilles Deleuze and Bernard Stiegler, both of whom are enjoying a high level of attention in Anglophone scholarship at the present moment. To properly engage with such thinkers must necessitate an engagement with the thought that so strongly influenced them, not least among them the works of Gilbert Simondon. This is without, of course, considering the obvious value of engaging with Simondon's work in and of itself - that is, in its own right rather than simply as a key to unlocking the works of later thinkers.

In this context, then, any and all translations of Simondon's work into English are welcomed with open arms. Adkins' translation of the first part of this still as-yet fully translated is an excellent contribution to the growing Anglophone literature on Simondon, yet its format as blog posts leaves it open to the typical degredations web content often undergoes (as any scholar dealing with the citation of historical web documents will be all too aware). To better preserve this work I have both archived the original blog posts (via Harvard Library Innovation Lab's perma.cc service) and, in the LaTeX project stored here, am reformatting the blog posts into a single PDF document to imrpove readability.

I hope this project is of use to anyone hoping to better grasp the thought of such a complex and influential thinker.
